Easiest way to identify the correlation among the variables 

## Function in deatil 

# Type 
B = Both Postive and negative correlation 
P = Positively correlated variables 
N = Negatively correlated variables

# Limt 
Setting the correlation limit

# Varaible1

Finading correlation each varaible wise
